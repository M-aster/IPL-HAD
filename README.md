A FLIR A615 long-wave TIR camera is employed to collect data on human actions in two open-air parking lots. Open-air parking lot 1 serves as a mixed parking area for cars and electric bikes, while open-air parking lot 2 is exclusively for electric bikes. Images were captured from the second and third-floor windows of a building, simulating a real-world surveillance perspective, as shown in Fig.2.
The FLIR A615 camera offers a detection wavelength range of 7.5-13 μm, a field of view of 25° × 19°, and a temperature detection range of -20 to +150°C. It boasts ±2°C detection accuracy and a thermal sensitivity of less than 0.05°C, along with selectable resolutions. The camera's uncooled microbolometer detector array has a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels. While TIR imaging is unaffected by external lighting conditions, it can be notably influenced by ambient temperature variation, leading to considerable variations in brightness, contrast, and sharpness across captured images. To address this challenge and ensure network robustness in real-world scenarios, a comprehensive data collection strategy was carried out. This strategy involved capturing data under various complex conditions, including different seasons, day and night settings, and varying weather conditions. We also captured images at multiple resolutions, mimicking the range of image sizes produced by diverse surveillance devices. This diverse dataset enhances the network's ability to perform effectively under varying environmental conditions.
